# Enhanced AWS CDK Project - Monitoring & Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Project Overview

This serverless application now includes enterprise-grade monitoring, observability, and multi-environment support with:

- **Structured Logging**: Winston-based JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Custom Metrics**: CloudWatch metrics for business and technical KPIs
- **X-Ray Tracing**: Distributed tracing for performance insights
- **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring with visual insights
- **Automated Alerts**: SNS-based alerting for critical issues
- **Environment Management**: Separate configurations for dev/staging/prod

## üìä Monitoring Features

### 1. Lambda Function Monitoring
- **Request Tracking**: Every request logged with correlation ID
- **Custom Metrics**: Request count, duration, success/failure rates
- **Business Metrics**: Users created, files uploaded, operations performed
- **Error Tracking**: Structured error logging with stack traces
- **Health Checks**: Database and S3 connectivity monitoring

### 2. CloudWatch Dashboard
- **Lambda Performance**: Invocations, errors, duration, concurrency
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Request count, latency, 4xx/5xx errors
- **DynamoDB Monitoring**: Read/write capacity, throttles, errors
- **Custom Application Metrics**: Business KPIs and operational metrics

### 3. Automated Alerts
- **High Error Rates**: > 5 errors in 5 minutes
- **Performance Issues**: > 10 second average duration
- **Throttling**: Any Lambda or DynamoDB throttles
- **Service Health**: API Gateway 5xx errors > 5 in 5 minutes

## üåç Environment Management

### Development Environment (`dev`)
```bash
npm run deploy:dev
```
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Resources**: Minimal capacity, short log retention
- **Monitoring**: Basic alerts to dev team
- **Cost**: Optimized for development

### Staging Environment (`staging`)
```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Resources**: Production-like capacity
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring with staging alerts
- **Cost**: Balanced performance and cost

### Production Environment (`prod`)
```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```
- **Purpose**: Live production workloads
- **Resources**: High availability, long retention
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive alerts to ops team
- **Cost**: Optimized for performance and reliability

## üîß Deployment Commands

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to development
npm run deploy:dev

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production (use with caution!)
npm run deploy:prod
```

### Advanced Operations
```bash
# View changes before deployment
npm run diff:dev
npm run diff:staging
npm run diff:prod

# Generate CloudFormation templates
npm run synth:dev
npm run synth:staging
npm run synth:prod

# Destroy environments (careful!)
npm run destroy:dev
npm run destroy:staging
```

### Monitoring Access
```bash
# Open monitoring dashboards
npm run monitor:dev
npm run monitor:staging
npm run monitor:prod
```

## üìà Key Metrics to Monitor

### Technical Metrics
- **Lambda Duration**: Response time trends
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Throttle Count**: Resource limit hits
- **Memory Utilization**: Lambda memory usage
- **Concurrent Executions**: Lambda scaling patterns

### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: New users per time period
- **File Uploads**: Storage usage growth
- **API Usage**: Endpoint popularity
- **Feature Adoption**: Business functionality usage

## üö® Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Lambda function errors > 5 in 5 minutes
- API Gateway 5xx errors > 5 in 5 minutes
- DynamoDB throttling detected
- Lambda function throttling

### Warning Alerts (Monitor & Plan)
- Average response time > 2 seconds for 15 minutes
- Memory utilization > 80% consistently
- Storage growth rate exceeding projections

## üìä Dashboard Widgets

### Lambda Performance Section
- **Invocations**: Request volume over time
- **Errors & Throttles**: Error tracking
- **Duration**: Performance trends
- **Concurrent Executions**: Scaling behavior

### API Gateway Section
- **Request Count**: Traffic patterns
- **Latency**: Response time distribution
- **Error Rates**: 4xx and 5xx tracking

### Custom Metrics Section
- **Business KPIs**: User and file metrics
- **Application Health**: Success rates
- **Database Operations**: Query patterns

## üîç Troubleshooting

### High Error Rates
1. Check CloudWatch Logs for error details
2. Examine X-Ray traces for bottlenecks
3. Verify database and S3 connectivity
4. Check recent deployments

### Performance Issues
1. Review Lambda duration metrics
2. Analyze X-Ray service map
3. Check memory utilization
4. Examine DynamoDB performance

### Missing Metrics
1. Verify IAM permissions for CloudWatch
2. Check Lambda environment variables
3. Ensure winston logging configuration
4. Validate custom metric namespace

## üéØ Best Practices

### Monitoring
- Set up alert fatigue prevention
- Use correlation IDs for request tracking
- Monitor business metrics alongside technical ones
- Regular dashboard review and optimization

### Deployment
- Always test in dev environment first
- Use staging for final validation
- Deploy production during low-traffic windows
- Monitor for 30 minutes after deployment

### Cost Optimization
- Regular review of log retention policies
- Optimize Lambda memory allocation
- Monitor and adjust DynamoDB capacity
- Use S3 lifecycle policies for storage
