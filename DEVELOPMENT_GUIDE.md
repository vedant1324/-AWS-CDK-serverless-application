# 🚀 **Complete AWS Local Development Guide**

## **Three Ways to Test Your CDK Lambda Application**

### **1. 📦 Built-in Mock Services (Current Setup)**
✅ **Already Working** - No additional setup needed

```bash
# Build TypeScript files first
npm run build

# Test with built-in mocks
npm run test-local

# Start API server (after building)
npm run start-api
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Zero dependencies
- ✅ Fast startup
- ✅ Complete control over test data
- ✅ Works offline

**Note:** Scripts require building TypeScript first (`npm run build`)

### **2. 🐳 LocalStack (AWS Service Emulation)**
⚙️ **Requires Docker Desktop**

```bash
# Build TypeScript files
npm run build

# Start LocalStack (requires Docker Desktop to be running)
npm run start-localstack

# Test with LocalStack (after building)
npm run test-with-localstack
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Real AWS API compatibility
- ✅ Perfect for integration testing
- ✅ Supports advanced AWS features
- ✅ Multiple service interaction

**Requirements:**
- Docker Desktop must be running
- AWS CLI installed (optional but recommended)
- TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)

### **3. ☁️ Real AWS (Production Testing)**
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Deploy to AWS
cdk deploy --all

# Test against real AWS services
```

## **🔧 Current Status & Recommendations**

### **What's Working Right Now:**
✅ **Mock API Server**: http://localhost:3000  
✅ **Enhanced Mock Services**: DynamoDB + S3 simulation  
✅ **Complete Testing**: All endpoints functional  

### **Available Commands:**
```bash
# Development Testing (Instant)
npm run test-local        # Direct Lambda testing
npm run start-api         # HTTP API server

# Unit Testing
npm test                  # Jest test suite

# Build & Validate
npm run build            # TypeScript compilation
cdk synth               # CloudFormation generation
```

### **LocalStack Setup (If Desired):**

1. **Start Docker Desktop**
2. **Run setup script:**
   ```powershell
   npm run start-localstack
   ```
3. **Test with LocalStack:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-with-localstack
   ```

---

## **🎯 Recommended Development Workflow**

### **Daily Development:**
1. Use **built-in mocks** for rapid development
2. Test with **mock API server** for frontend integration
3. Run **Jest tests** for validation

### **Integration Testing:**
1. Use **LocalStack** for realistic AWS behavior
2. Test complex multi-service scenarios
3. Validate CloudFormation templates

### **Pre-Production:**
1. Deploy to **AWS dev environment**
2. Run integration tests against real services
3. Performance and load testing

---

## **🚨 Troubleshooting LocalStack**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"localstack command not found"**
   - Use Docker directly: `docker run localstack/localstack`
   - Or use our setup script: `npm run start-localstack`

2. **Docker not responding**
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Check: `docker --version`

3. **Port conflicts**
   - Default port: 4566
   - Check: `netstat -an | findstr 4566`

### **Alternative LocalStack Start:**
```bash
# Direct Docker command
docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack
```

## **📊 Testing Comparison**

| Feature | Built-in Mocks | LocalStack | Real AWS |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Setup Time | Instant | 2-3 minutes | 5-10 minutes |
| Cost | Free | Free | Paid |
| Realism | Good | Excellent | Perfect |
| Speed | Fastest | Fast | Slower |
| Offline | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Dependencies | None | Docker | AWS Account |
